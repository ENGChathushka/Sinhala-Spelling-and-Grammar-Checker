Sinhala Spell and Grammar Checker
This project aims to develop an effective Spell and Grammar Checker for Sinhala, one of the official languages of Sri Lanka. Given the complex script and intricate grammatical structure of Sinhala, detecting and correcting errors in digital text is a significant challenge. This tool is designed to assist in identifying spelling mistakes and providing grammar suggestions in Sinhala, with applications in social media, text messaging, and online communication.

Key Features:
Rule-Based Model: Utilizes predefined linguistic rules to detect common errors like incorrect word endings or missing letters.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Model: Combines information retrieval and text generation to suggest corrections for a variety of spelling and grammar errors.
LSTM Model: A deep learning approach using Long Short-Term Memory networks to learn the patterns of Sinhala text errors and generate appropriate corrections.
BERT Model: Leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), fine-tuned on Sinhala text, to provide context-aware suggestions for spelling and grammar mistakes.

Objectives:
Improve the quality of written Sinhala in digital spaces.
Develop a system that can detect and correct common spelling and grammar mistakes.
Contribute to the development of digital tools for better communication and education in Sinhala.

Technologies Used:
    Python
    Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, RAG)
    PyTorch
    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks
    Rule-Based Approaches

Results:
The models are evaluated for their performance across different types of errors in Sinhala, and their accuracy is measured. The analysis will help identify the most effective approach for building an accurate Sinhala spell and grammar checker.
