# Sinhala-Spelling-and-Grammar-Checker
This repository implements a Sinhala Spell and Grammar Checker using three models: Rule-based, RAG, and LSTM. The project automatically detects and corrects spelling and grammar errors in Sinhala text, combining machine learning and traditional methods for improved accuracy and quality of written Sinhala.
